# An English Translation of Grothendieck's *SGA*

The purpose of this project is to crowdsource an English translation of  Alexander Grothendieck's notes from the [*Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie (SGA)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Séminaire_de_Géométrie_Algébrique_du_Bois_Marie).
Thanks to a [project led by Frank Calegari, Jim Borger, and William Stein](http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~edix/public_html_rennes/sgahtml/), a typeset copy of the *SGA* (in french) can be found [here on the ArXiv:0206203](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0206203). While some knowledge of French will be useful in order to contribute to this project, it's not strictly necessary. Some knowledge of algebraic geometry and [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/Séminaire%20de%20Géométrie%20Algébrique%20du%20Bois%20Marie) is sufficient.

## To-do
 - Setup the Projects page (?).
 - ~Add a bunch of `\newcommands` to a common file, so we can more easily keep notation consistent through the translation.~
 - Consider adding the `\newenvironments` to their own file and standardizing those too?
 - Translate the thing. ;)
 - Have a current working compiled version of the document in the repository.
 - Create a title page and cover page.
